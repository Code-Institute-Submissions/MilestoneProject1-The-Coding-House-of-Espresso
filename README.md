## Am I Responsive 



# 1. Project purpose and introduction

This Website was built to perform the first task called Milestone Project 1 defined by Code Institute during the Fullstack Web Developer Course. Under the process of creation used technologies were following languages: HTML and CSS with additional Bootstrap framework.

## The Coding House of Espresso 

[View the live project here](https://maggiedaisy.github.io/MilestoneProject1-The-Coding-House-of-Espresso/)

This project aims to create a responsive website for a coffee shop located in the most popular and attractive district of central Oslo. The website is dedicated to general visitors such as students and digital workers who would like to have their own meeting place while experiencing unforgettable coffee experiences.

# 2. UXD – User Experience Design

### User Stories 

Potential users are customers who want to have a great experience with coffee taste and preparation while discussing new technologies inspirations in a dedicated community. Customers who want to get knowledge about the quality of coffee beans, brewing methods, and equipment used for preparation as well as customers who want to share digital knowledge in the same place.

* As a user of the website, I wish that design is responsive, so I can look at the page on different size of devices

### Strategy

The main goal of this website is to present and advertise the hangout place or second office, for both, coffee and code enthusiasts. This website is built for a local coffee shop and is dedicated to potential customers who will be interested in buying products and services, as well as spending working or studying time in a dedicated community. To improve the way of easy navigation, the website is constructed to be consistent and intuitive. Content is divided for clearly, visible sections and all navigation elements are clickable. The presentation of place, team, services, and products is giving a clear possibility to find need able information. The design of a website is responsive, so allows viewing page on different devices, as a first-come mobile approach which is very useful for today's generation smartphone users. Contact form and social media icons can be found very easily during the navigation website process.


### Scope

Taking into consideration a beginner level of designing skill ability, the website provides 
Functional requirements - responding to customer first needs, easy to navigate, informative, responsive
Non-functional requirements - contained content includes text and images which provide a functional space for the user.

### Structure 

The presentation of information contained on the website is structured, learnable, and intuitive, first interaction enables quick finding information and orientation between features. The text content is short and consistent and the imagery is simple and clean, both describe place and services very well. Contact section with contact form and footer with social media buttons allow for easy access to be in touch.

# 7. Version Control

Git - free and open-source distributed Version Control System was used to show tracking all changes during the coding process. 
Git add, Git commit, Git push commands were used to approve and store files in the repository. 

# 8. Deployment

This project was developed by using GitHub - a code hosting platform and Gitpod - an online Integrated Development Environment. There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
The first step was to create a new "Repository" named Milestone project 1 in GitHub. Then once opened in Gitpod the whole process started by creating a structure of files and then the very first boilerplate of code, then successively with time whole code structure. Next, the code was pushed to GitHub where was stored in my Repository. 
### Deployment using GitHub pages:
* Navigate to the Git Hub Repository - [My Repository](https://github.com/MaggieDaisy/MilestoneProject1-The-Coding-House-of-Espresso)
* Then, right under the "Settings" section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section.
* After, select a "master branch" under "source" drop-down and click "save" button
* Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and then you can click to URL link to go directly to the live deployed page
### Deployment using Run Locally:
* The code can be also run locally, optional through clone or download 
* Navigate and open the repository, click on the green "Code" button, and select either "clone" or "download".
* The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
* The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file that can be unzipped, unpacked, and displayed on your local computer.
