# 1. Project purpose and introduction

This Website was built to perform the first task called Milestone Project 1 defined by Code Institute during the Fullstack Web Developer Course. Under the process of creation used technologies were following languages: HTML and CSS with additional Bootstrap framework.

## The Coding House of Espresso 

[**View the live project here**](https://maggiedaisy.github.io/MilestoneProject1-The-Coding-House-of-Espresso/)

This project aims to create a responsive website for a coffee shop located in the most popular and attractive district of central Oslo. The website is dedicated to general visitors such as students and digital workers who would like to have their own meeting place while experiencing unforgettable coffee experiences.

# 2. UXD – User Experience Design

### **User Stories**

Potential users are customers who want to have a great experience with coffee taste and preparation while discussing new technologies inspirations in a dedicated community. Customers who want to get knowledge about the quality of coffee beans, brewing methods, and equipment used for preparation as well as customers who want to share digital knowledge in the same place.

* As a user of a website, I wish to be able to navigate very easily, so I can find interesting content
* As a user of the website, I wish to be able to learn about the place and provides services, so I can gain information is this place I am looking for
* As a user of the website, I wish to find an accessible contact form, so I can ask bothering questions or subscribe to the newsletter
* As a user of the website, I wish to find information about localization and opening hours, so I can be a guest of a place
* As a user of the website, I wish to have visible access to social media, so I can follow and be a part of the community
* As a user of the website, I wish that design is responsive, so I can look at the page on different size of devices

### **Strategy**

The main goal of this website is to present and advertise the hangout place or second office, for both, coffee and code enthusiasts. This website is built for a local coffee shop and is dedicated to potential customers who will be interested in buying products and services, as well as spending working or studying time in a dedicated community. To improve the way of easy navigation, the website is constructed to be consistent and intuitive. Content is divided for clearly, visible sections, and all navigation elements are clickable. The presentation of place, team, services, and products is giving a clear possibility to find need able information. The design of a website is responsive, so allows viewing page on different devices, as a first-come mobile approach which is very useful for today's generation smartphone users. Contact form and social media icons can be found very easily during the navigation website process.

### **Scope**

Taking into consideration a very beginner level of designing skill ability, the website provides:
* Functional requirements - responding to customer first needs, easy to navigate, informative, responsive, intuitive.
* Non-functional requirements - contained content includes text and images which provide a functional space for the user.

### **Structure**

The presentation of information contained on the website is structured, learnable, and intuitive, first interaction enables quick finding information and orientation between features. The text content is short and consistent and the imagery is simple and clean, both describe place and services very well. Contact section with contact form and footer with social media buttons allow for easy access to be in touch. Shop section with buy here buttons takes a user to other aside real existing shops. 

### **Skeleton**

[**Wireframes:**](/assets/docs/Sketch_MS1.pdf)
* 1 single page with 5 different content sections and the possibility to navigate between them
* 5 sections called: Home, About, Menu, Shop, Contact
* Header – fixed header with a hero image, brand name, and navigation bar
* Footer – fixed footer with social media icons 

### **Surface**

Visual experience reflecting the coffee-based beverages color and coffee texture to bring a clean, warm, and retro feeling.
* Colors

Neutral tones, like a blend of milk and coffee colors, reflecting the served beverages and create a cozy and calm down atmosphere. Throughout the whole project were used two main colors, such as dark brown (SaddleBrown #8B4513 rgb(139, 69, 19)) and light cream color (Cornsilk #FFF8DC rgb(255, 248, 220)) to create visual contrast between elements and sections. In addition, one more color was picked, like light brown (SandyBrown #F4A460 rgb(244, 164, 96)) for hover active elements like buying and submit buttons, social media icons, and links til sections.

* Typography

Font 'Inconsolata' used for the retro visual experience for whole-body content, selected from google fonts.

* Images

The selection of images has been made to present beverages and food served in the shop. Image presentation shows an interior design of the place as well as barista team members and potential guests.

# 3. Features

# 7. Version Control

Git - free and open-source distributed Version Control System was used to show tracking all changes during the coding process. 
Git add, Git commit, Git push commands were used to approve and store files in the repository. 

# 8. Deployment

This project was developed by using GitHub - a code hosting platform and Gitpod - an online Integrated Development Environment. There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
The first step was to create a new "Repository" named Milestone Project 1 in GitHub. Then once opened in Gitpod the whole process started by creating a structure of files and then the very first boilerplate of code, then successively with time whole code structure. Next, the code was pushed to GitHub where was stored in my Repository. 
### Deployment using GitHub pages:
* Navigate to the Git Hub Repository - [**My Repository**](https://github.com/MaggieDaisy/MilestoneProject1-The-Coding-House-of-Espresso)
* Then, right under the "Settings" section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section.
* After, select a "master branch" under "source" drop-down and click "save" button
* Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and then you can click to URL link to go directly to the live deployed page
### Deployment using Run Locally:
* The code can be also run locally, optional through clone or download 
* Navigate and open the repository, click on the green "Code" button, and select either "clone" or "download".
* The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
* The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file that can be unzipped, unpacked, and displayed on your local computer.
